# todo-list
To Do List is a single page web app that lets users manage a simple list of tasks. Users can add and remove tasks from the list. It was coded using standard technologies like HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript; and has an object-oriented approach using a model view presenter pattern. Feel free to give me feedback or contact me about this project.
